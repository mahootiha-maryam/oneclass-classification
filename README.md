# oneclass-classification
One-class classification algorithms can be used for binary classification tasks with a severely skewed class distribution. 
One-class classification algorithms can be effective for imbalanced classification datasets where there are none or very few examples of the minority class, or datasets where there
is no coherent structure to separate the classes that could be learned by a supervised algorithm.
